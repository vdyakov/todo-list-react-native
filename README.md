### Description

It's a test project using react-native and expo.<br />
The main goal of this project is to compare [pwa](https://github.com/vdyakov/todo-list-react), [react-native](https://github.com/vdyakov/todo-list-react-native) and [flutter](https://github.com/vdyakov/todo-list-flutter) in writing a to-do application.

### Requirements

1. [Node.js LTS or Current release](https://nodejs.org).
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

### Development

In the project directory, you can run:

```
1. npm install -g expo-cli
2. npm install
3. npm start
```

Developer tools open at [http://localhost:19002](http://localhost:19002).

The fastest way to get up and running is to use the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device.<br />
Expo Go allows you to open up apps that are being served through Expo CLI.
